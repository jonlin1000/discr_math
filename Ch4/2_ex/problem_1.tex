This problem gives you some more practice with the divides $\mid$ notation.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Prove by use of the contrapositive method that if $a \nmid b$ and $a \mid c$, then $a \nmid (b + c)$. 
    
    \item Prove the result in the first part, but using contradiction instead. (Try doing this part if you're having trouble with the first part)
\end{enumerate}
