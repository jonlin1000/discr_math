\begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose $a$, $b$, and $c$ are odd integers. Prove that the polynomial $p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ only has irrational roots.
    \item After you have proved this, look up the Rational Root Theorem on your own time. Try to find a proof of this statement. Is the proof direct or indirect? Does it depend on facts which you don't know? Is the approach the same as this exercise (This is a judgement which depends on your taste).
    \item Think about this part after tomorrow's lecture. How similar is this proof to the proof that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational? In some sense this part is even more subjective than the previous part.
\end{enumerate}
