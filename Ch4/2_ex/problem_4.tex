Prove that $u$ is an irrational number if and only if $1 + 3u$ is an irrational number. If you are feeling particularly saucy today, prove one direction using contradiction and another direction using contrapositive. (Reminder that proving an if and only if implication $P \iff Q$ requires proving both $P \implies Q$ and $Q \implies P$.)
