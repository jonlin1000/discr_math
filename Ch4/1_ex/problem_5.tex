(Challenge Problem) Suppose $p$ is a prime number greater than $3$. (A prime number $p$ is a positive integer which has no positive integer divisors other than $1$ and itself. For example, $2$, $3$, and $101$ are prime, but $15$ is not (since $3$ divides $15$).
Prove that $p^2$ is $1$ more than a multiple of $24$, that is there exists some integer $k$ such that $p^2 = 24k + 1$.
(Hint: at some point you will have to use the result of the previous problem.)
