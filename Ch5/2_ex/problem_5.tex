Suppose that there are $n$ people that board a flight. They seat themselves one at a time. The first person has forgotten which seat he is assigned, and picks a random seat to sit in. Each subsequent person either sits in their designated seat, or if it is already occupied, they sit in a remaining seat randomly (as in uniformly random).
\begin{enumerate}
	\item When $n = 2$, what is the probability that the last person (person $2$) sits in the seat that he is assigned?
	\item What about when $n = 3$? $n = 4$?
	\item Make a conjecture for general $n$ and prove your conjecture using strong induction.
\end{enumerate}
