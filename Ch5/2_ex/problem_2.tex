In discussion, I presented the following notion of strong induction (which we called Weak Induction$++$):
\begin{theorem}
Let $P(n)$ be a proposition, and suppose the following statements hold:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $P(0)$ and $P(1)$ is true.
    \item If $P(n-1)$ and $P(n)$ are true for $n \geq 1$, then $P(n + 1)$ is true.
\end{itemize}
The conclusion is that $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
\end{theorem}

Generalize this theorem to multiple base cases.
