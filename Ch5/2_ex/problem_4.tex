The following problem outlines a proof of the so called \textbf{arithmetic-geometric mean inequality}: for all non-negative reals $a_1, \dots, a_n$ we have
\[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i \geq \sqrt[n]{\prod_{i = 1}^na_i}.\]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item When $n = 1$ this inequality is trivially true. For $n = 2$: Note that for all $a > 0$ there is $b > 0$ such that $b^2=a$. Use this fact and the fact that $(x - y)^2 \geq 0$ for all (non-negative) $x$ and $y$ to show directly that the inequality is true when $n = 2$.
    \item Suppose this inequality is true for $n = k$. Using the $n = 2$ case, show that this inequality is true for $n = 2k$. 
    \item Supposing this inequality is true for $n = k$, show that this inequality is true for $n = k-1$.
    \item Conclude that we are done. (This method of proof is called \textbf{Cauchy Induction}.)
\end{enumerate}
