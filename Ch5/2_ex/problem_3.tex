Recall during discussion when we proved that $a_n \leq (7/4)^{n + 1}$, we stated an inductive hypothesis which was similar to that in Theorem 1. Explain why we couldn't state and prove the inductive hypothesis with only one base case $n = 0$, mimicking the format of the above theorem. (Recall that for $n \geq 2$, we had $a_n = a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}$.)
