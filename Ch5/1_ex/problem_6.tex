(Challenge Problem): Prove Euler's Formula: For any convex polyhedron, the formula
\[v - e + f = 2\] holds, where $v$ is the number of vertices, $e$ is the number of edges, and $f$ is the number of faces. You will want to induct on the number of vertices for $v \geq 4$ (because the notion of ``face'') doesn't make sense for $v < 4$. Your proof will probably not be completely rigorous, and that's okay. (Hints: For the base case, a tetrahedron is the only You cannot solve this problem by just chopping off a vertex, as in general the vertices which are adjacent to the vertex you are attempting to chop off are not generally going to be all in a shared plane. Look up ``edge contraction'' if you are stuck without ideas about the inductive step.)
