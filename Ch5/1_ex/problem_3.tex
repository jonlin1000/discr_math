Take a couple of minutes and try to prove by induction that for any integer $n \geq 1$, we have
\[\sum_{k = 1}^n\frac{1}{k^2} < 2.\]
(You won't be able to do it!)

Let's prove something seemingly ``stronger'': Prove by induction that for any integer $n \geq 1$ we have
\[\sum_{k = 1}^n\frac{1}{k^2} < 2 - \frac{1}{n},\] which implies the above result.
