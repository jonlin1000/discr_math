Prove by induction the following equalities for appropriate integers. You, the reader, will have to determine the appropriate base case.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \[\sum_{k = 1}^nk = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}.\] (For a solution, peep Jason's lecture!)
    \item \[\sum_{k = 1}^nk(k + 1) = \frac{n(n + 1)(n + 2)}{3}.\]
    \item \[\sum_{k = 1}^nk(k + 1)(k + 2) = \frac{n(n + 1)(n + 2)(n + 3)}{4}.\]
    \item
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \[\sum_{k = 0}^n2^k = 2^{k + 1} - 1.\]
        \item \[\sum_{k = 0}^n3^k = \frac{3^{k + 1} - 1}{2}\]
        \item \[\sum_{k = 0}^n4^k = \frac{4^{k + 1} - 1}{3}.\] Also explain alternatively how we can use the example in the Monday discussion to prove this result.
        \item State the pattern you see, and prove your general result using induction.
        \item Using the so called ``high-school'' algebra identity
        \[(x - 1)(x^n + x^{n-1} + \cdots + x + 1) = x^{n + 1} - 1,\] give another proof of your general result. (This will be a non-inductive proof).
