A \textit{triomino} is an ``L'' shaped tile formed by 3 adjacent squares of a chessboard. We say that an arrangement of triominos is a \textit{tiling} of a chessboard if every square of the chessboard is covered without any triominos overlapping.

Prove by induction that for all integers $n \geq 1$ the $2^n \times 2^n$ sized chessboard missing one square (in ANY location) can be tiled. The fact that $3 \mid (2^n2^n - 1 = 4^n - 1)$ is a consequence of problem 1diii.
