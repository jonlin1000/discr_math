In this section we highlight the notion of a boolean expression as a function. Using this perspective it will be clear what it means for two expressions to be logically equivalent. 

\begin{tcolorbox}
A function will take a value (a number, an animal, anything) and output another value (a letter of the alphabet, the number of the animal's legs, anything). Later on we will learn a more rigorous definition than that described above.
\end{tcolorbox}

Then a boolean expression is really a function. Each variable takes in either true or false, at which point we can \textit{evaluate} the expression and we get some boolean value (either true or false). Consider the expression
\[(p \land q) \lor r.\]
Then we can feed in any combination of trues or falses. For example, if $p \equiv T$, $q \equiv F$, and $r \equiv T$, then the expression above will evaluate these values to 
\[(T \land F) \lor T \equiv F \lor T \equiv T,\] or true.

A \textbf{truth table} is then really just a way of recording the output values of this function. We summarize our findings here:
\begin{tcolorbox}
Two logical expressions are called \textbf{logically equivalent} if they have the same truth value given a set of truth values for each variable.

Equivalently, two logical expressions are logically equivalent if they have the same truth table.
