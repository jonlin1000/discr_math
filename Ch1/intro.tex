The first topic of this book deals with logical symbols and their manipulations. We will also introduce various other kinds of logical operators as well. The study of such manipulations has great connections with the notion of \textbf{mathematical proof}, which is an essential theme of this book (from Chapter 4 on, most of the concepts and problems will be of things that are \textit{proven}, not computed). These operators will be useful in later parts of the book. To introduce these concepts we will motivate them by first discussing some physical analogues of these concepts that appear frequently in daily life.
