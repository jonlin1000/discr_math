Create truth tables for the following expressions.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $p \land (\sim p)$ (This formula is called \textit{unsatisfiable}. Why is this?)
    \item $p \land T$ (Here, $T$ represents true. Similarly, $F$ represents false).
    \item $p \land F$
    \item $p \lor T$ and $p \lor F$.
\end{itemize}
