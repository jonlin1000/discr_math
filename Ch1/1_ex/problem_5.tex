This problem mostly deals with the implies $(\implies)$ logical operator. The motivation behind this operator is that eventually we want to do \textbf{proofs}. That is, given a set of initial hypotheses, we want to make deductions and logically deduce that a conclusion is true. For example, eventually all of you will be able to prove, roughly stated:
\[(\text{$n$ is even}) \implies (\text{$n + 1$ is odd}).\]

Construct the truth tables for all the logical expressions below.
%I'll cover the first two bullets in class.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $p \implies (p \land q)$ and $p \implies (p \lor q)$.
    \item $(p \land q) \implies (p \lor q)$. This formula is an example of a \textit{tautology}.
    \item $(p \lor q) \implies (p \land q)$.
    \item $(p \implies q) \implies (p \iff q)$.
    \item $(p \iff q) \implies (p \implies q)$.
    \item $p \implies q \implies r$ and $p \implies r$.
\end{itemize}
