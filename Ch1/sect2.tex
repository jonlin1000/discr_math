In this worksheet, we will briefly discuss a property of boolean formulas called \textbf{satisfiability}. This was briefly discussed on the last worksheet, with respect to the boolean formula $p \land (\lnot p)$.

\begin{tcolorbox}
 A boolean formula is \textbf{satisfiable} if there exists an assignment of true or false to each of its variables which makes the formula evaluate to true. Note that we only need \textit{one} such assignment of variables.
 A boolean formula is \textbf{unsatisfiable} if it isn't satisfiable. In particular, all assignments of variables will evaluate to false.
\end{tcolorbox}

For example, the formula $p \land q \land r$ is satisfiable (with satisfying assignment $p \equiv q \equiv r \equiv T$. And this is the ONLY satisfying assignment).
