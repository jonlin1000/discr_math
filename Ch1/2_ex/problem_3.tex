Sometimes, despite the computational time it takes to find a satisfying assignment, some unfortunate circumstance may require that you do so. This problem will outline one or two heuristics in order to possibly simplify your job a little further.

Consider the boolean formula

\[(x_1 \land x_5 \land x_2) \lor (x_3 \land (\neg x_3) \land x_5) \lor (x_2 \land (\neg x_7) \land x_6 \land x_1 \land (\neg x_4)).\]

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Notice that this formula is in \textit{disjunctive normal form}. That is, it can be represented as an OR of ANDS. Explain how this might simplify our problem a little bit.
    \item Simplify the formula by considering the variable $x_3$.
    \item Discuss (with your neighbors) the theoretical or practical use of such simplifications.
\end{enumerate}
