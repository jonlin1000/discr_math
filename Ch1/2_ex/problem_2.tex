Explain why a boolean formula with $n$ variables has $2^n$ different assignments.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose I was to tell you that a certain boolean formula was satisfiable. What would I need to tell/demonstrate to you in order to convince you of this fact? How much time would it take?
    \item Suppose on the other hand I was to tell you that a certain boolean formula was \textit{unsatisfiable}. What would I need to demonstrate to you in order to convince you of this fact? How much time would it take?
\end{enumerate}
