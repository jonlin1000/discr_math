In this chapter we explore some consequences of a basic mathematical fact called the \textbf{Pigeonhole Principle}. Although the statement itself is very elementary, the various consequences and results that one can obtain as a consequence of this basic fact are very deep and surprising. In the first section we will explore the pigeonhole principle's application in the finite case and the infinite case.
