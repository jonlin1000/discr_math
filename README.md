# discr_math
A book on discrete math. Loosely based on the content covered in UMD's CMSC250.

Currently, the sections will be loosely based on the following:

1. Basic propositional/formal logic, quantifier logic
2. Formal Circuits and connections with propositional logic. The half, full, n-bit adders.
3. Basic (naive) set theory. Functions and Relations.
4. Basic proof techniques. Direct, Contrapositive, Contradiction. The field axioms.
5. Basic proof techniques. The Well Ordering Principle, and proof by induction ("weak" and "strong" variants)
6. Basic number theory. Applications of basic proof techniques. Divisibility, modular arithmetic.
7. Counting and Probability. permutations and combinations. Probability, expectation, variance.
8. Appendix: Sequences and Sums

With additions once these sections have been loosely implemented.

------

Todo:

- Add content for Chapter 7.
- Expand on Chapter 1, with relevant definitions and examples. Write up the recursive presentation of boolean expressions.
- Expand on Chapter 2, especially about formal circuits. Rework the adders section to be an actual section and not just a big exercise to the reader.
- Add more relevant problems to Chapter 2.
- Write a proper exposition for chapter 3. Formally define all the things. Define Cartesian product.
- Write something about equivalence relations. Motivation for relations needs to be written up.
- Write proper exposition for proofs in Chapter 4. Highlight the connection between formal logic and proofs, especially the goal in proving things.
- Write exposition for proofs by contrapositive and contradiction. Add some examples.
- Write exposition for the field axioms for the rational and real numbers, and create various exercises.
- Write exposition for the Well Ordering Principle. Write a proof of Well Ordering implies Principle of Mathematical Induction. Write a proof of Well Ordering implies Principle of Strong Mathematical Induction. Write a proof of Weak Induction implies Strong Induction. Write up examples. Add lots of problems.
- In Chapter 6, add more advanced number theory topics, such as RSA and Miller Rabin. Add more exercises.

- Get rid of references to "class" or "discussion", remnants from discussion section notes.
- Add a proper bibliography for sources that inspired the book.
