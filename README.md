# discr_math
A book on discrete math. Loosely based on the content covered in UMD's CMSC250.

Currently, the sections will be loosely based on the following:

1. Basic propositional/formal logic, quantifier logic
2. Formal Circuits and connections with propositional logic. The half, full, n-bit adders.
3. Basic (naive) set theory. Functions and Relations.
4. Basic proof techniques. Direct, Contrapositive, Contradiction. The field axioms.
5. Basic proof techniques. The Well Ordering Principle, and proof by induction ("weak" and "strong" variants)
6. Basic number theory. Applications of basic proof techniques. Divisibility, modular arithmetic.
7. Counting and Probability. permutations and combinations. Probability, expectation, variance.
8. The Pigeonhole Principle and its Generalizations.
9. Basic Linear Algebra. Matrix Multiplication and applications.
10. Appendix: Sequences and Sums

With additions once these sections have been loosely implemented.

Todo:

The important thing right now to do is to add more content.

- Expand on Chapter 1, with relevant definitions and examples. Write up the recursive presentation of boolean expressions. Rewrite the satisfiability section. Add proper motivation for the symbol pushing manipulation of boolean expressions in the section currently titled "Untitled."
- Expand on Chapter 2, especially about formal circuits. Rework the adders section to be an actual section and not just a big exercise to the reader.
- Add more relevant problems to Chapter 2. Learn material to put in chapter 2 to give it substance.
- Write a proper exposition for chapter 3. Define the Cartesian product. Define an order relation. Define what it means to be a minimal and maximal element in an ordered set.
- Write something about equivalence relations. Motivation for relations needs to be written up.
- Write proper exposition for proofs in Chapter 4. Highlight the connection between formal logic and proofs, especially the goal in proving things.
- Write exposition for proofs by contrapositive and contradiction. Add some examples.
- Write exposition for the field axioms for the rational and real numbers, and create various exercises. (Chapter 4)
- ~~Write exposition for the Well Ordering Principle.~~ ~~Write a proof of Well Ordering implies Principle of Mathematical Induction.~~ ~~Write a proof of Well Ordering implies Principle of Strong Mathematical Induction.~~ ~~Write a proof of Weak Induction implies Strong Induction.~~ Write up examples. Add more problems about least upper bound property.
- In Chapter 6, add more advanced number theory topics, such as RSA and Miller Rabin. Add some proofs of infinitude of primes. Add more exercises.
- In Chapter 7, Discuss stars and bars. Discuss the principle of Inclusion and Exclusion. Formally define a discrete probability space. Define expectation and variance. Add applications to algorithms. Add exercises for each section so far. 
- In Chapter 8, prove the Erdos-Szekeres theorem. Write about peak points. Prove the Infinite Ramsey Theorem. Prove the Finite Ramsey Theorem in two ways (from the Infinite Ramsey Theorem and by Induction). Prove Van der Warden's Theorem and discuss several applications. 
- Write Chapter 9. Define Multiplication of Matrices. Discuss the motivation for matrices. Read the relevant CLRS Chapter on Matrix Operations. Read about and describe relevant applications. Write about polytopes?

- Get rid of references to "class" or "discussion", remnants from discussion section notes.
- ~~Add a proper bibliography for sources that inspired the book.~~
