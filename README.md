# discr_math
A book on discrete math. Loosely based on the content covered in UMD's CMSC250.

Currently, the sections will be loosely based on the following:

1. Basic propositional/formal logic, quantifier logic
2. Formal Circuits and connections with propositional logic. The half, full, n-bit adders.
3. Basic (naive) set theory. Functions and Relations.
4. Basic proof techniques. Direct, Contrapositive, Contradiction. The field axioms.
5. Basic proof techniques. The Well Ordering Principle, and proof by induction ("weak" and "strong" variants)
6. Basic number theory. Applications of basic proof techniques. Divisibility, modular arithmetic.
7. Counting and Probability. permutations and combinations. Probability, expectation, variance.
8. Appendix: Sequences and Sums

With additions once these sections have been loosely implemented.
