In this problem we outline a proof of the \textbf{Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic}: the statement that every positive integer greater than $1$ factors uniquely into primes.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Use induction to show that for a prime $p$ and integers $a_1, \dots, a_n$ that if $p \mid a_1\cdot \dots\cdot a_n$, then $p \mid a_i$ for some $1 \leq i \leq n$. 
	\item This fact implies unique factorization in the following sense: Suppose that $n$ is an integer with two different factorizations. Take a prime $p$ in one factorization. Then prove that $p$ must occur in the other factorization. (For an elegant proof, use the well ordering principle to derive a contradiction.)
\end{enumerate}
