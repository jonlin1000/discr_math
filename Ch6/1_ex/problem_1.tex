Suppose $m$ and $n$ are integers. Then consider the set $S$ of all $k$ such that $k$ is an integer linear combination of $x$ and $y$. Let $g = \gcd(m, n)$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose $g \mid k$. Prove that there are $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $mx + ny = k$.
    \item Suppose $g \nmid k$. Prove (by contradiction) that there are no $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $mx + ny = k$. Hence the only integer linear combinations of $m$ and $n$ are multiples of $g$.
\end{enumerate}
