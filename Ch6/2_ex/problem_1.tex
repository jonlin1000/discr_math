Write out a proof of the equivalence of definitions of the very last box. That is, suppose that the quotient remainder theorem is true. Then, using the definition of mods as given, show that the assertion made in the last box holds as a result. Conversely, assume that the statement in the last box holds, and use it to give a proof of the quotient remainder theorem.
