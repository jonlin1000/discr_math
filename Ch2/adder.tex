This worksheet mostly has to do with the half and full-adder constructions discussed in lecture. I will review the half adder and we will build up to the full adder and $n$-bit adders in the problems below. I'll also review addition in binary, just to make sure everyone has it down. 
 \begin{enumerate}
   \item \input{Ch2/2_ex/problem_0}
   \item \input{Ch2/2_ex/problem_1}
   \item \input{Ch2/2_ex/problem_2}
 \end{enumerate}
