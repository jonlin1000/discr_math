\subsection{Definition and Notation}

Most roughly speaking, a set is a collection of objects. These objects can be numbers, people, or even other sets themselves. In general this collection need not be homogeneous (so for example, we can have a set which contains both a number and a person). For the purposes of this book, we will not even try to discuss a formal logical definition of a set (this gets very complicated). So for the rest of this book we can assume that a set is a collection of objects without any issues whatsoever.

In general, when we are describing sets as a collection of specific objects, we tend to use curly braces $\{\}$ to enclose these objects while delimiting them by commas.

\begin{example}
If we wanted to describe the set containing the numbers $1$, $2$, and $3$, we would do so as $\{1, 2, 3\}$. The set $\{1, \{1, 2\}\}$ is the set which contains the number $1$, and the set $\{1, 2\}$ containing $1$ and $2$.

The set $\{1, 1\}$ is the set containing the numbers $1$, \ldots and $1$? Since $1$ and $1$ are in fact the same this set is the same as $\{1\}$. We will make this example more formally clear later in the chapter.
\end{example}

In general describing sets like this gets awkward when the number of elements that the set contains gets very large. For example, it is very awkward to write out 
\[\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\}\]
to describe the set of positive integers between $1$ and $15$ inclusive. There are a couple of things we can do. For most purposes if we instead wrote this set as
\[\{1, 2, 3, \dots, 14, 15\}\]
where most people would understand what the set was. Another thing we can do is use a variable, such as $A$, to denote the set of positive integers between $1$ and $15$ inclusive. The best convention is to combine these two notions. We can define
\[A = \{1, 2, 3, \dots, 14, 15\}.\]
In this formulation $A$ is defined as the set of positive integers between $1$ and $15$ inclusive. Once we have defined $A$ in this way we can freely use just the character ``$A$'' instead of $\{1, 2, 3, \dots, 14, 15\}$, which is a good way to write concisely.

In general, we can refer to any abstract set using a variable such as $A$, $B$, etc. (In general most people will use capital letters to refer to sets). 

\begin{example}
The set $\mathbb{N}$, known as the set of \textbf{natural numbers}, denotes the set of positive integers. That is,
\[\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, \dots\}.\]
The set $\mathbb{Z}$ (german for \textit{Zahlen}) denotes the set of all integers. That is,
\[\mathbb{Z} = \{\dots, -2, 1, 0, 1, 2, \dots\}.\]
In some texts people include $0$ in the natural numbers. This is entirely a matter of convention and not for any very deep reason. Sometimes it is convenient to include $0$. 

The empty set, denoted $\varnothing$ is the set which does not contain any elements.
\end{example}

\subsection{Set Inclusion and Set Equality}

The first thing we describe in this section is notation to describe whether an object (usually denoted by a lowercase letter) is in a certain set. We use the $\in$ notation in order to do so. That is, we say that 
\[x \in A\]
if the object $x$ is in the set $A$. Alternatively if an object $x$ is not in $A$ we write $x \not\in A$ instead.

\begin{example}
Let $A = \{1, 2, 3, \dots, 14, 15\}$. Then $6 \in A$. 

The empty set $\varnothing$ has the property that $x \not\in A$ for any conceivable object $x$.
\end{example}

The notion of set containment, which is an inquiry about whether any object is contained in a set, leads naturally to a general notion of inquiring whether some set is contained inside another. The definition for this is pretty natural. Roughly speaking, a set $A$ is contained in a set $B$ only if all the objects contained in $A$ are also contained in $B$. We make this notion more formal now.

\begin{definition}
Suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets. Then we say that $A \subset B$ if we have for every $x \in A$ we have $x \in B$ also.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
We have 
\[\{1, 2\} \subset \{1, 2, 3\}.\]
\end{example}

A closely related concept to set inclusion is set equality. Below we define set equality. Roughly two sets are equal if they contain the same elements. We will define set equality then using the subset definition.
\begin{definition}
Suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets. Then $A = B$ if $A \subset B$ and $B \subset A$.
\end{definition}

This definition roughly encodes the notion of set equality. Since in the definition of subset, $A \subset B$ if all the elements of $A$ were in $B$. So two sets $A$ and $B$ are equal if all the elements of $A$ are in $B$, and all the elements of $B$ are in $A$. This raises some subtle, but not particularly deep observations.

\begin{example}
We claim that 
\[\{1, 2, 3, 3\} = \{1, 2, 3\}.\]

This can be easily verified using the definition of set equality. However it is true that both sets do not ``look'' the same. 
\end{example}

This subtlety with multiple elements in a set shows that we only need to consider sets where each element of the set is unique in that set, since such a set will always be equal to one with the same elements but maybe some of them duplicated. %%probably a terrible explanation.

\subsection{Common Set Operations}

In this section we describe common set operations used to manipulate sets and create new sets. First we will explain why this is useful. In practice, when one is using sets, in general one considers sets with certain properties. That is one would like to consider perhaps certain objects with a certain property. In practice one would define these sets using \textbf{set builder notation}. The idea of defining such a set $S$ is encapsulated in the notation below.

\[S = \{\text{all the objects $x$ of some type} \colon \text{$x$ has some special property}\}.\]
Let's break down this notation further. With this notation, it is accepted that $S$ is defined to be the set of all objects $x$ such that $x$ has a special property. For example, the set 
\[S = \{x \in \mathbb{Z} \colon |x| \leq 5\}\]
is the set of integers with absolute value less than or equal to $5$. In other words,
\[S = \{-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}.\]
In general set builder notation is very useful to create sets of objects with certain properties.
