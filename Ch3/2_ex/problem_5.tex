(The classification of symmetric, transitive relations.) Let $A$ be a non-empty set, and suppose that $R$ is a non-empty relation which is symmetric and transitive. Show there is a non-empty set $B \subseteq A$ for which $R$ is an equivalence relation restricted to $B \times B$. Explicitly describe the set $B$. (It might help to do the second part of problem 2 first.)
