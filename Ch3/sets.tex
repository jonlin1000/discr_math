Hopefully with this worksheet we'll cover the set theory required for all of you to finish the homework good and proper.

 \begin{enumerate}
   \item \input{Ch3/1_ex/problem_1}
   \item \input{Ch3/1_ex/problem_2}
   \item \input{Ch3/1_ex/problem_3}
   \item \input{Ch3/1_ex/problem_4}
   \item Last question, not really about set theory, but rather about quantifiers. Consider the propositional statement
   \[(\forall x \in \varnothing)[x = 5].\]
   Is this true? False? Discuss with your tablemates. After this, consider the proposition
   \[(\forall x \in \varnothing)[x \in A]\] where $A$ is any set. (Hopefully, from this we see that $\varnothing \subseteq A$ for all sets $A$!)
